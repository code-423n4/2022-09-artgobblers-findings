The overall code is very well written, here are some suggestions :


1. Lack of event emission after sensitive actions:

In Goo.sol, we have to similar functions used to burn Goo. The difference lies in the caller of the function. 
The event emitted by the ERC20 contract will be the same and we will not be able to track if the burn has been done by pages or by the artGobblers contract. 

```
function burnForGobblers(address from, uint256 amount) external only(artGobblers) {  
        _burn(from, amount);
    }

function burnForPages(address from, uint256 amount) external only(pages) {
        _burn(from, amount);
    }
```

2. Give the user the possibility of burning the most emissionMultiple gobbler when minting a legendary gobbler.
A user possibly submits more gobblers than price to mint a legendary gobbler because he doesn't know the exact price.
```
function mintLegendaryGobbler(uint256[] calldata gobblerIds) external returns (uint256 gobblerId)
```
mintLegendaryGobbler functions iterate the array of gobblers burnin one to one until the price is fulfilled and the legendary gobbler's emission multiple will be 2 times the accumulated by the gobblers burned.  You can add a boolean variable indicating if the user wants to burn his gobblers decreasingly in emission multiple.

# Quality Assurance Report

## Executive Summary
Codebase looks mature and well thought-out.
Documentation is complete and testing coverage is high.
The codebase could benefit with a few small adjustments to further simplify the codebase.

## Issues 


|   |      Issue     |  Instances |
|----------|-------------|:------:|
| 1 |  Left shift could be replaced by mul | 1 |
| 2  |    Minor oversight - Internal Function is named as if it was public Function is `internal` not prefixed with `_`    |   1 |
| 3  |  Missing checks for address(0x0) when assigning values to address state variables  |   3 |
| 4  |  Inconsistent use of inline delete  |  1 |

### 1. Left shift could be replaced by mul
Quoting `transmissions11` here https://github.com/artgobblers/art-gobblers/issues/145
the left shift doesnt save any gas and just hurts readability

### POC 

```solidity
 uint256 newNumMintedForReserves = numMintedForReserves += (numGobblersEach << 1); 
```

https://github.com/artgobblers/art-gobblers/blob/c821b6d48f836ccf5d152c75584bb9792bba774f/src/ArtGobblers.sol#L844


### 2. Minor oversight - Internal Function is named as if it was public Function is `internal` not prefixed with `_`

Function getNextValidator() is `internal` but not prefixed with `_`
### POC 

```solidity
    function updateUserGooBalance(
        address user,
        uint256 gooAmount,
        GooBalanceUpdateType updateType
    ) internal {
```
### Instances

```

### 3. Missing checks for address(0x0) when assigning values to address state variables 

### Summary 
Zero address should be checked for state variables and some parameters in functions like mints, withdrawals... A zero address can lead into problems.

### POC
 ```solidity  
     constructor(
        // Mint config:
        bytes32 _merkleRoot,
        uint256 _mintStart,
        // Addresses:
        Goo _goo,
        Pages _pages,
        address _team,
        address _community,
        RandProvider _randProvider,
        // URIs:
        string memory _baseUri,
        string memory _unrevealedUri
    )
        GobblersERC721("Art Gobblers", "GOBBLER")
        Owned(msg.sender)
        LogisticVRGDA(
            69.42e18, // Target price.
            0.31e18, // Price decay percent.
            // Max gobblers mintable via VRGDA.
            toWadUnsafe(MAX_MINTABLE),
            0.0023e18 // Time scale.
        )
    {
        mintStart = _mintStart;
        merkleRoot = _merkleRoot;

        goo = _goo;
        pages = _pages;
        team = _team;
        community = _community;
 ```
### Mitigation
Check zero address for state variables before assigning to them a value

### Instances
```
2022-09-artgobblers/src/ArtGobblers.sol:316:9
2022-09-artgobblers/src/ArtGobblers.sol:317:9
2022-09-artgobblers/src/Goo.sol:83:9
```

### 4.  Inconsistent use of inline delete
Gas costs are the same. More readable Less complex Less likely for solidity to have issues with it since itâ€™s less esoteric. Deletion of field inside and outside the event have no difference in gas costs. 

### Reference 
https://github.com/artgobblers/art-gobblers/issues/149

### POC 
```solidity  
emit Transfer(msg.sender, getGobblerData[id].owner = address(0), id);
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-artgobblers/blob/2ae644ace932271fb34399c1c0771aabae2e423c/src/ArtGobblers.sol#L287-L329

Missing checks for zero-addresses may lead to infunctional protocol, if the variable addresses are set  incorrectly.
variable: address _team, address _community

require(address _team != address(0));.
require(address _community != address(0));.

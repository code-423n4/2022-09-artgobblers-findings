Title: Use `safeTransfer`/`safeTransferFrom` consistently instead of `transfer`/`transferFrom`

Impact:
It is good to add a require() statement that checks the return value of token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelinâ€™s safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.

Proof of Concept:
[ArtGobblers.sol#L747-L748](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-artgobblers/blob/main/src/ArtGobblers.sol#L747-L748)

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider using safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom or require() consistently.
